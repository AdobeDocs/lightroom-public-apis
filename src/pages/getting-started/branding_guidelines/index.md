# Branding Guidelines

- Adhering to all trademark guidelines is required as noted here: https://www.adobe.com/legal/permissions/trademarks.html 

- For Lightroom, the first and most prominent reference should utilize the full product name – "Adobe Photoshop Lightroom" or "Adobe Photoshop Lightroom Classic", depending on the product – after which just "Lightroom" or "Lightroom Classic" may be used 

- When referring to photos in Lightroom cloud storage, use the Lightroom branding and do not use the Creative Cloud branding
