# Lightroom Partner App Example: Node.js

This sample app will show you how to implement Lightroom Partner App and Adobe OAuth 2.0 using Node.js.

After setting up the sample, you will have a Node.js app that:

1. Runs on `https://localhost:8000`
1. Lets a user log in with their Adobe ID
1. Prompts the user to authorize the app with requested scopes
1. Lets the user view their account information
1. Lets the user view their catalog information
1. Lets the user upload an image to their catalog
1. Lets the user download different renditions of their uploaded image

## Technology Used

1. Node.js and the `npm` package manager
1. OpenSSL CLI

## Prerequisites

This guide will assume that you have read the [Integration Document](https://www.adobe.io/apis/creativecloud/lightroom/docs.html#!quickstart/integration.md).

You must also have a registered app on the Adobe Developer Console with the following settings:

1. `Platform`: web
1. `Default redirect URI`: `https://localhost:8000`
1. `Redirect URI Pattern`: `https://localhost:8000`

## Configuration

The following steps will help you get this sample up and running.

### Create an OpenSSL cert

Adobe OAuth 2.0 requires SSL, so you will need to create a self-signed cert using the OpenSSL CLI. Be sure to run this in the `./server` directory:

```
$ cd server
$ openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -out cert.pem -keyout key.pem -days 365
```

Make sure that after running this command you have the `cert.pem` and `key.pem` files at the top level of the `.server` directory.

### Install Node.js packages

The `package.json` file contains a list of dependencies. Run the following command from the top level directory of the app to install these dependencies:

```
$ cd ..
$ npm install
```

### Enter your Adobe API credentials

Enter the required credentials in `public/config.js`:

```javascript
const adobeApiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY";
const adobeApiSecret = "YOUR_API_SECRET";

try {
  if (module) {
    module.exports = {
      adobeApiKey: adobeApiKey,
      adobeApiSecret: adobeApiSecret,
    }
  }
}
catch (err) {}
```

You can get your Adobe API Key and Secret from your registered app page on the [Adobe Developer Console](https://console.adobe.io).


## Usage

After completing the configuration steps, start the server:

```
$ npm start
```

To access the app, go to `https://localhost:8000`. Click through any cert warnings in the browser.
